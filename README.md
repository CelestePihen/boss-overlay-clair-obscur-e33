# Boss Overlay for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

![Image de l'application](/img.jpg)

---
This application allows you to see your progress against the game's bosses in real time. Some bosses are not detected automatically, so you will need to manually check the corresponding box.  
The application is still under development, so if you encounter any bugs, please report them!  

Thanks to [CO E33 Save Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/201) from infarctus for some [code snippets](https://github.com/Infarctus/CO-E33_Save_editor).  

*Note: Since I saw that no one had made a "Boss Overlay" for COE33 yet, I wanted to try making one, but I wanted to have some quick software to see if it would work. So the project is (it pains me to say it) vibecoded. Of course, I plan to learn more so I don't have to do this again, even though there are both good and bad aspects to vibecoding.*
